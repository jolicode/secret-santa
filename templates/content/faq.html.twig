                                We receive only the data mandatory to start the Secret Santa:
                                the list of users and usergroups in your organization.
                                Everything will be forgotten automatically after you finished the draw!
                                In fact, we do not even have a database ðŸ˜®

                                An alternative could be to launch 2 Secret Santa with two groups of people.

                                in the

                                The first step in our application is to retrieve all the users on your Slack workspace
                                / Discord server - yes we retrieve all the users to allow you to select
                                the
                                ones that will participate to your Secret Santa.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When your team is really big, Slack or Discord API can fail to send us all the
                                users in a
                                reasonable duration. That means you will not be able to start a Secret Santa.
                                A possible workaround would be to create a new Slack workspace / Discord server /
                                with only the participants.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The second step is to dispatch a private message to all the selected users. Even if you
                                started
                                a Secret Santa with a lot of participants, the application will send all the messages
                                progressively.
                                So there should not be any problem at this step.

                                Discord has an option to allow someone to not receive private message on a their server
                                they
                                belongs to.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you throw a Secret Santa in a server where a user does not allow to receive private
                                message,
                                Discord will prevent us to send them a message. So if you hit this error, you need to
                                ask
                                them
                                to <strong>change their privacy settings</strong> on this server. See the example below:
                            </p>
                            <div class="is-center">
                                <img src="{{ asset('images/discord-privacy-settings.gif') }}" style="max-width: 80%"

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                Once they made the change, you can safely retry to send the remaining messages. When the
                                draw is finished,
                                they can of course re-disable this setting as they wish.
                            </p>

                                conversation on the Discord desktop app (for Windows, MacOS or Linux) or on the website.
