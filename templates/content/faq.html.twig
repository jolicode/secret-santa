                            We receive only the data mandatory to start the Secret Santa:
                            the list of users and usergroups in your organization. Once the private messages have been sent,
                            we forget everything! In fact, we do not even have a database ðŸ˜®

                            We show you all the Users in your team. Just select the ones which will take part to your Secret Santa by clicking on their names.<br/>

                        <p>
                            Optionally, you can add a custom message that will be sent along the Secret Santa draw.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can always preview the private message that will be sent with the following button, that
                            will send you and only you a custom message:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once you are ready, you can submit the Secret Santa by clicking this big red button:
                        </p>
                        <div class="is-center">

                                Finish and send Secret Santa messages!
                            </button>

                        <p>
                            This will trigger the following operations:

                        <p>
                            No, the association is purely random so you cannot do that with our application.
                            An alternative could be to launch 2 Secret Santa with two groups of people.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            No, you can't. However, you can still start a new Secret Santa. We advice you to add a note in the
                            message mentioning that this new draw cancel and replace the old one.
                        </p>

                    <li id="big-team">

                            <a href="#big-team">Will the app work with team larger than 500 people?</a>
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            There is a 2 things to understand here. The first step in our application is to retrieve
                            all the users on your Slack workspace / Discord server / Zoom.us Chat - yes we retrieve
                            all the users to allow you to select the ones that will participate to your Secret Santa.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When your team is really big, Slack, Discord or Zoom.us APIs can fail to send us all the users in a
                            reasonable duration. That means you will no be able to start a Secret Santa. A
                            possible workaround would be to create a new Slack workspace / Discord server / Zoom.us Chat
                            with only the participants.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second step is to dispatch a private message to all the selected users. Even if you started
                            a Secret Santa with a lot of participants, the application will send all the messages progressively.
                            So there should not be any problem here.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Discord</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li id="discord-server-dm">
                        <h3>
                            <a href="#discord-server-dm">What to do when a user does not allow to receive private message on a Discord server?</a>
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Discord has an option to allow someone to not receive private message on a their server they
                            belongs to.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you throw a Secret Santa in a server where a user does not allow to receive private message,
                            Discord will prevent us to send them a message. So if you hit this error, you need to ask them
                            to <strong>change their privacy settings</strong> on this server. See the example below:
                        </p>
                        <div class="is-center">
                            <img src="{{ asset('images/discord-privacy-settings.gif') }}" alt="How to change the privacy settings on Discord" />
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Once they made the change, you can safely retry to send the remaining messages. When the draw is finished,
                            they can of course re-disable this setting as they wish.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li id="invalid-user">
                        <h3>
                            <a href="#invalid-user">Why did someone receive <code>@invalid-user</code> as the person to gift?</a>
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            This is due to a known bug of the Discord Android application. The workaround is to open the
                            conversation on the Discord desktop app (for Windows, MacOS or Linux) or on the website.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
