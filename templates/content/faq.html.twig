                            <em>Short answer:</em>
                            Nothing :)

                            <em>Detailled answer:</em>
                            We receive only the data mandatory to start the Secret Santa:
                            the list of users and usergroups in your organization. Once the private messages have been sent,
                            we forget everything! In fact, we do not even have a database ;)
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            No, the association is purely random so you cannot do that with our application.
                            An alternative could be to launch 2 Secret Santa with two groups of people.

                            Simply drop us an email at <a href="mailto:hello@secret-santa.team">hello@secret-santa.team</a>
                            with the name, url and logo of the entity you want to add.

                            <a href="#big-team">Will you app work with team with more than 500+ people?</a>

                        <p>
                            There is a 2 things to understand here. The first step in our application is to retrieve
                            all the users on your Slack workspace / Discord server - yes we retrieve all the users to allow
                            you to select the ones that will participate to your Secret Santa.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When your team is really big, Slack or Discord APIs can fail to send us all the users in a
                            reasonable duration. That means you will no be able to start a Secret Santa at the moment. A
                            possible workaround would be to create a new Slack workspace / Discord server with only the
                            participants.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second step is to dispatch a private message to all the selected users. Even if you started
                            a Secret Santa with a lot of participants, we will safely handle that. If the operation times out
                            we will propose you to continue the sending as if nothing happened.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li id="invalid-user">
                        <h2>
                            <a href="#invalid-user">Why did someone receive <code>@invalid-user</code> as the person to gift?</a>
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            This is due to a known bug of the Discord Android application. The workaround is to open the
                            conversation on the Discord desktop app (for Windows, MacOS or Linux) or on the website.
                        </p>
