                            <strong>Detailled answer</strong>:
                            We receive only the data mandatory to start the Secret Santa:
                            the list of users and usergroups in your organization.
                            Everything will be forgotten automatically after you finished the draw!
                            In fact, we do not even have a database 😮

                            This project do not use a database. Every data is stored only during
                            the time of your session and will be deleted a few hours after your last
                            interaction with the application.

                        <p>
                            Once authenticated with your favorite Chat tool, you will be prompted with the User Selection screen.<br/>
                            We show you all the users in your team. Just select the ones which will take part to your Secret Santa by clicking on their names.<br/>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            On the second screen, you will be able to customize a bit the message that will be sent to every participant.
                            You can add an optional message that will be sent along the Secret Santa draw. You can even add details about every participant to help Santas achieve their mission.
                        </p>

                        <div class="is-center">

                        <p>
                            You can always preview the private message that will be sent with the following button, that
                            will send you and only you a fake message:
                        </p>

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once you are ready, you can submit the Secret Santa by clicking this big red button:
                        </p>
                        <div class="is-center">

                                Shuffle and send Secret Santa messages!
                            </button>

                        <p>
                            This will trigger the following operations:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Shuffle all the users;</li>

                            <li>Send a private message to the admin (you) with details.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>And that's it, you are done!</p>
                    </li>

                        <p>
                            Don't worry! The draw works perfectly no matter how many participants
                            you selected (of course we need a minimum of 2 participants 😉).

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            No, the association is purely random so you cannot do that with our application.
                            An alternative could be to launch 2 Secret Santa with two groups of people.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            No, you can't. However, you can still start a new Secret Santa. We advice you to add a note in the
                            message mentioning that this new draw cancel and replace the old one.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li id="big-team">
                        <h3>
                            <a href="#big-team">Will the app work with team larger than 500 people?</a>
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            The first step in our application is to retrieve all the users on your Slack workspace
                            / Discord server / Zoom.us Chat - yes we retrieve all the users to allow you to select the
                            ones that will participate to your Secret Santa.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When your team is really big, Slack, Discord or Zoom.us APIs can fail to send us all the users in a
                            reasonable duration. That means you will not be able to start a Secret Santa.
                            A possible workaround would be to create a new Slack workspace / Discord server / Zoom.us Chat
                            with only the participants.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second step is to dispatch a private message to all the selected users. Even if you started
                            a Secret Santa with a lot of participants, the application will send all the messages progressively.
                            So there should not be any problem at this step.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Discord</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li id="discord-server-dm">
                        <h3>
                            <a href="#discord-server-dm">What to do when a user does not allow to receive private message on a Discord server?</a>
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Discord has an option to allow someone to not receive private message on a their server they
                            belongs to.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you throw a Secret Santa in a server where a user does not allow to receive private message,
                            Discord will prevent us to send them a message. So if you hit this error, you need to ask them
                            to <strong>change their privacy settings</strong> on this server. See the example below:
                        </p>
                        <div class="is-center">
                            <img src="{{ asset('images/discord-privacy-settings.gif') }}" alt="How to change the privacy settings on Discord" />
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Once they made the change, you can safely retry to send the remaining messages. When the draw is finished,
                            they can of course re-disable this setting as they wish.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li id="invalid-user">
                        <h3>
                            <a href="#invalid-user">Why did someone receive <code>@invalid-user</code> as the person to gift?</a>
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            This is due to a known bug of the Discord Android application. The workaround is to open the
                            conversation on the Discord desktop app (for Windows, MacOS or Linux) or on the website.
                        </p>
                    </li>
