Code source is under MIT License.

## Install and run locally

The app requires:

- a Redis server
- PHP 7.1+

Run the following command to install the app locally:

`composer install`

We rely on some env variables to communicate with Slack API and Redis.
Check out the .env file and fill the correct values for the following variables:

- `SLACK_CLIENT_ID`: Application id from Slack;
- `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET`: Application secret from Slack;
- `REDIS_URL`: The full redis connexion url (default `redis://localhost:6379`)

Then launch this command:

`make serve`

The application should now be running on http://127.0.0.1:8000.
